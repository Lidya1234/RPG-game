- The game scene is the main scene where you play the game.
- In the game, there are two characters and also balls the moves in all direction.
- These balls disappear if they overlap with any of those two characters.
- The characters are the players 
- Since this is a turn-based game the players have idle and active states
- One can change the state of a character using the spacebar.
- When all the balls disappear it will take you to the credits scene.
- In the credits scene it will display the final score which is the highest of the two scores displayed in the game scene.
- And there is a form where you can fill in the username and click submit
- It will submit the final score and the username to the leaderboard API.
- At the bottom there is a leaderboard button click it.
