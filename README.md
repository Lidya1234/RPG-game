PreloaderScene :
- Will load all the assets needed for the game scene and it will show the progress until it loads everything.
- Then it will pass you to the title scene which has a play button that opens the game scene.
- The game scene is the main scene where you play the game.
- In the game, there are two characters and also balls the goes in all direction.
- These balls disappear if they overlap with any of those two characters.
- The characters are the players 
- Since this is a turn-based game the players have idele and active states
- One can change the state of a character using the spacebar.
- When all the balls disappear it will take you to the credits scene.
- In the credits scene it will tell the final score which is the highest of the two scores.
- And there is a form where you can fill in the username and click submit
- It will submit the final score and the username to the leaderboard API.
- At the bottom there is a leaderboard button click it.
- The button will take you to the leaderboard scene.
- Then you will see a list of users with their scores and rank.
