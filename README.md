[Live Demo](https://morrism1.github.io/todoList)

## Getting Started

one user can either play the game online by clicking here OR Clone from the git here, the process of cloning are listed below in the getting started part.
Scene-boot:

It will narrate the game and ask a user to press ENTER,
If the user doesn't click on the ENTER, the game will start automatically after 4 seconds.
Which will lead to scene-main.
Scene-main:

User can see a character/avatar on the screen at this point, which already has started running on the platform.
The avatar/character will die if it falls from the platform or catches fire.
These situations can be avoided with 1 or 2 jumps.
In the path the avatar/character can earn a point/score by catching the stars appearing on the path.
To get a score the avatar/character has to jump again sometimes.
The avatar/character can jump(one mouse-click)/ doublejump(double mouse-click).
If the avatar/character died from the fire or by falling from the platform, then the Scene Game_Over will appear.
Scene-game-over:

Here User can see an input filed, a submit-score button, a restart button, and a Leaderboard button.
The input filed: here the user can enter the name.
The submit-score button: by clicking the send score button the sore will be sent to a leader board.
The restart button: by clicking it the user can restart the game again.
Leaderboard button: clicking here will invoke the scene leader-board.
Scene-leader-board:

Here a list will be displaying sorting by the high score.
